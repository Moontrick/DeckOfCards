DeckOfCards
===========
Some work I'm doing for another project that will involve a traditional deck of cards

Right now if you drag the Deck prefab to the scene it will automatically generate all the appropriate cards, with suits and values.

To be added soon to this is the concept of a dealer, which will handle all movement of cards, ie dealing them out, trash cards, shuffling, etc.
